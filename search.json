Requirement is defined via :ref:`metadata routing `.\nFor instance, this can be used to pass a validation set through the pipeline.\n\nYou can only set this if metadata routing is enabled, which you\ncan enable using ``sklearn.set_config(enable_metadata_routing=True)``.\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.6\nNone\n\n\n\nmemory memory: str or object with the joblib.Memory interface, default=None\n\nUsed to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline.

Be aware that the memory usage\nof this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`\nbecause it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.\n- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'\nand 'saga' are faster for large ones;\n- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default.

This technique speeds up convergence. The algorithm implemented is \"greedy k-means++\". It differs from the vanilla k-means++ by making several trials at each sampling step and choosing the best centroid among them.\n\n* 'random': choose `n_clusters` observations (rows) at random from data for the initial centroids.\n\n* If an array is passed, it should be of shape (n_clusters, n_features) and gives the initial centers.\n\n* If a callable is passed, it should take arguments X, n_clusters and a random state and return an initialization.\n\nFor an example of how to use the different `init` strategies, see\n:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_kmeans_digits.py`.\n\nFor an evaluation of the impact of initialization, see the example\n:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_kmeans_stability_low_dim_dense.py`.\n'k-means++'\n\n\n\nn_init n_init: 'auto' or int, default='auto'\n\nNumber of times the k-means algorithm is run with different centroid\nseeds. The final results is the best output of `n_init` consecutive runs\nin terms of inertia. Several runs are recommended for sparse\nhigh-dimensional problems (see :ref:`kmeans_sparse_high_dim`).\n\nWhen `n_init='auto'`, the number of runs depends on the value of init:\n10 if using `init='random'` or `init` is a callable;\n1 if using `init='k-means++'` or `init` is an array-like.\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.2\nAdded 'auto' option for `n_init`.\n\n.. versionchanged:: 1.4\nDefault value for `n_init` changed to `'auto'`.\n'auto'\n\n\n\nmax_iter max_iter: int, default=300\n\nMaximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm for a\nsingle run.\n300\n\n\n\ntol tol: float, default=1e-4\n\nRelative tolerance with regards to Frobenius norm of the difference\nin the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations to declare\nconvergence.\n0.0001\n\n\n\nverbose verbose: int, default=0\n\nVerbosity mode.\n0\n\n\n\nrandom_state random_state: int, RandomState instance or None, default=None\n\nDetermines random number generation for centroid initialization.
