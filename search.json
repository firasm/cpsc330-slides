Default is 'lbfgs'.\nTo choose a solver, you might want to consider the following aspects:\n\n- 'lbfgs' is a good default solver because it works reasonably well for a wide\nclass of problems.\n- For :term:`multiclass` problems (`n_classes &gt;= 3`), all solvers except\n'liblinear' minimize the full multinomial loss, 'liblinear' will raise an\nerror.\n- 'newton-cholesky' is a good choice for\n`n_samples` &gt;&gt; `n_features * n_classes`, especially with one-hot encoded\ncategorical features with rare categories. Be aware that the memory usage\nof this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`\nbecause it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.\n- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'\nand 'saga' are faster for large ones;\n- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a\none-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the\n:class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.\n\n.. warning::\nThe choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`\nfor L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 &lt; l1_ratio &lt; 1` for\nElastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:\n\n================= ======================== ======================\nsolver l1_ratio multinomial multiclass\n================= ======================== ======================\n'lbfgs' l1_ratio=0 yes\n'liblinear' l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no\n'newton-cg' l1_ratio=0 yes\n'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0 yes\n'sag' l1_ratio=0 yes\n'saga' 0&lt;=l1_ratio&lt;=1 yes\n================= ======================== ======================\n\n.. note::\n'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features\nwith approximately the same scale.
