## Motivation

- **Time series** is a collection of data points indexed in time order. 
- Time series is everywhere:
    - Physical sciences (e.g., weather forecasting)  
    - Economics, finance (e.g., stocks, market trends)
    - Engineering (e.g., energy consumption)
    - Social sciences 
    - Sports analytics

## Applying existing methods

What are some challenges we might have with time series data?

### Dataset

We'll be starting with the [CitiBike dataset](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) today
