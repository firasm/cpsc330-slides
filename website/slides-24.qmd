## ❓❓ Questions for you

Imagine you've created a machine learning model and are eager to share it with others. Consider the following scenarios for sharing your model:

- **To a non-technical Audience:** How would you present your model to friends and family who may not have a technical background?
- **To a technical audience:** How would you share your model with peers or professionals in the field who have a technical understanding of machine learning? 
- **In an academic or research setting:** How would you disseminate your model within academic or research communities?

## Try out this moment predictor

- In this lecture, I will show you how to set up/develop this. 

## What is deployment? 

- After we train a model, we want to use it!
- The user likely does not want to install your Python stack, train your model.
- You don't necessarily want to share their dataset.
- So we need to do two things:
  1. Save/store your model for later use.
  2. Make the saved model conveniently accessible.

## We will use the tools below for 

- Saving the model: We will use [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/) 
- Making the saved model conveniently accessible: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) & [render](https://render.com/)

## Course evaluations (~10 mins)

- They help us improve our teaching!
- UBC & CS uses them to provide rewards to instructors and TAs who are doing well!
- UBC & CS uses them to identify where instructors, TAs and courses need additional supports to improve.
- UBC uses these in evaluating professors for tenure and promotion.
- I'll very much appreciate your constructive and concrete feedback.  

## What did we cover 
- Part 1: Supervised learning on tabular data: ML fundamentals, preprocessing and data encoding, a bunch of models, evaluation metrics, feature importances and model transparency, feature selection, hyperparameter optimization
 
- Part 2: Dealing with other non-tabular data types: Clustering, recommender systems, computer vision with pre-trained deep learning models (high level), language data, text preprocessing, embeddings, topic modeling, time series, right-censored data / survival analysis

- Part 3: Communication, Ethics, and Deployment

## What we didn't cover 
- How do these models work under the hood

## What would I do differently?

Lots of room for improvement. Here are some things on my mind.  

- Balance the pace of the course a bit more (too intense at the beginning, too relaxed at the end!)
- Flipped classroom in a more effective way in the first part of the course. 
- More demos during lecture time
- Worksheets/practice questions during tutorials 
- Add a course project !?!
- Add more interactive components in the lectures
- Some material to cover: dealing with outliers, data collection, large language models

## What next?

If you want to further develop your machine learning skills:
- Practice!
- Work on your own projects
- Work hard and be consistent.

- If you are interested in research in machine learning
  - Take CPSC 340. If you do not have the required prereqs you can try to audit it.
- Get into the habit of reading papers and replicating results

## ❓❓ Questions for you

For each of the scenarios below 

- Identify if ML is a good solution for a problem.
- If yes
    - Frame the problem to a ML problem.
    - Discuss what kind of features you would need to effectively solve the problem
    - What would be a reasonable baseline? 
    - Which model would be a suitable model for the given scenario? 
    - What would be the appropriate success metrics.
