She has some experience in Python programming. She knows machine learning as a buzz word. During her recent internship, she has developed some interest and curiosity in the field. She wants to learn what is it and how to use it. She is a curious person and usually has a lot of questions!  \n:::\n\n::::\n\n<!-- \n## You all\n\n- Introduce yourself to your neighbour. \n- Since we're going to spend the semester with each other, I would like to know you a bit better. \n- Please fill out [Getting to know you survey](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/149122/quizzes) when you get a chance. \n-->\n\n## 🎯 Learning Outcomes {.smaller}\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n\n- Explain the difference between AI, ML, and DL\n\n- Describe what machine learning is and when it is appropriate to use ML-based solutions.\n\n- Briefly describe supervised learning.\n\n- Differentiate between traditional programming and machine learning.\n\n- Evaluate whether a machine learning solution is suitable for your problem or whether a rule-based or human-expert solution is more appropriate.\n\n- Navigate the course materials and get familiar with the course syllabus and \npolicies.  \n\n## About this course\n\n## CPSC 330 website\n\n- Course Jupyter book: https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2\n- Course GitHub repository: https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W2\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nCourse website: [https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2) is the most important link. You can access the course website from Canvas.\n\n![](img/canvas.png)\n\nPlease read everything on there!\n\nYou can find the source code for everything we do here: https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nMake sure you go through the syllabus thoroughly and complete the syllabus quiz before next class! \n:::\n\n## Asking questions during class\n\nYou are welcome to ask questions by raising your hand!\n\nIf you would prefer to write notes and ask questions later, you are more than welcome to do that also! Use Ed Discussion.\n\n## Registration, waitlist and prerequisites\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nPlease go through [this document](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2/syllabus/#registration) carefully before contacting your instructors about these issues. Even then, we are very unlikely to be able to help with registration, waitlist or prerequisite issues.\n:::\n\n- We are expecting that all students registered on the waitlist have already, or will soon get a notification to join the course!\n- The waitlist will close on Friday at 3 PM and no more students will be able to register after that!\n- It is your responsibility to catch up on any missed work.\n\n## Lecture format\n\n- In person lectures Tuesday and Thursday from 3:30 PM - 5 PM\n- There will be videos to watch before almost every lecture. You will find the list of pre-watch videos in the schedule on the course webpage.\n- We will also try to work on some questions and exercises together during the class. \n- All materials will be posted in this GitHub repository. \n<!-- - Weekly tutorials will be **office hour format** run by the TAs and are **completely optional**. -->\n  <!-- - You do not need to be registered in a tutorial. -->\n  - You may attend any tutorials or office hours your want, regardless of in which/whether you're registered.\n\n## Home work assignments\n- First homework assignment is due soon, it will be released to you today.\n- This is a relatively straightforward assignment on Python. If you struggle with this assignment then that could be a sign that you will struggle later on in the course.    \n- You must do the first two homework assignments on your own.\n\n## Exams \n\n- We'll have two self-scheduled midterms over a few day window and one final exam in Computer-based Testing Facility (CBTF). \n\n<!-- \n## Course calendar\n\nHere is our course Calendar. Make sure you check it on a regular basis: \n\n[https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W2/blob/main/docs/calendar.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W2/blob/main/docs/calendar.html)\n -->\n\n## Course structure\n\n- Part I: Introduction, ML fundamentals, preprocessing, midterm 1\n- Part II: Unsupervised learning, transfer learning, common special cases, midterm 1\n- Part III: Communication and ethics\n  - ML skills are not beneficial if you can't use them responsibly and communicate your results. In this module we'll talk about these aspects. \n## Code of conduct\n\n- Our main forum for getting help will be [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/join/rNVu2p).\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nPlease read [this entire document about asking for help](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2/docs/asking_for_help.html).\n**TLDR:** Be nice.\n:::\n\n# Setting up your computer for the course \n\n# Tools used in this course\n\nWe will use the following tools throughout the course:\n\n- **Coding:** `Python`, with either `Jupyter Lab` or `VS Code`\n- **Version Control:** `git` and `GitHub`\n- **Assignment Submission:** `Gradescope`\n- **Discussion Forum:** `Piazza`\n- **Exams and Final Grades:** `PrairieLearn` and `Canvas`\n- **Recommended Browsers:** [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)\n\n## Course `conda` environment\n\n- Follow the setup instructions [here](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W1/docs/setup.html) to create a course `conda` environment on your computer. \n- If you do not have your computer with you, you can partner up with someone and set up your own computer later.\n\n## Python requirements/resources {.smaller}\n\nWe will primarily use Python in this course.\n\nHere is the basic Python knowledge you'll need for the course: \n\n- Basic Python programming\n- Numpy\n- Pandas\n- Basic matplotlib\n\nHomework 1 is all about Python.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nWe do not have time to teach all the Python we need \nbut you can find some useful Python resources [here](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W1/blob/main/docs/resources.md).  \n:::\n\n<br><br>\n\n## Workload \nWhat does a typical week look like?\n\n- **Before class:** Watch pre-lecture videos or preview notes  \n- **In class:** Two 80-minute lectures with iClicker questions, activities, and live demos  \n- **Support:** Weekly tutorials and office hours  \n\n- **Practice:** Weekly assignments (except exam weeks)  \n\n## Tips for success:\n\n- Attend lectures regularly and ask questions  \n- Start homework early. Hands-on practice is essential  \n\n- Use Generative AI tools **responsibly**. No blind copy-pasting  \n\n- Always question your data, methods, and results — justify your choices  \n\n## Homework format: Jupyter lab notebooks\n\n- Our notes are created in a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), with file extension `.ipynb`.\n- Also, you will complete your homework assignments using Jupyter notebooks.\n- Confusingly, \"Jupyter notebook\" is also the original application that opens `.ipynb` files - but has since been replaced by **Jupyter lab**.\n  - I am using Jupyter lab, some things might not work with the Jupyter notebook application.\n  - You can also open these files in Visual Studio Code.\n\n## Jupyter lab notebooks \n\n- Notebooks contain a mix of code, code output, markdown-formatted text (including LaTeX equations), and more.\n- When you open a Jupyter notebook in one of these apps, the document is “live”, meaning you can run the code.\n\nFor example:\n\n::: {#f3267b49 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```\n2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#00eeb117 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = [1, 2, 3]\nx[0] = 9999\nx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=4}\n```\n[9999, 2, 3]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## More about Jupyter lab\n\n- By default, Jupyter prints out the result of the last line of code, so you don't need as many `print` statements.\n- In addition to the \"live\" notebooks, Jupyter notebooks can be statically rendered in the web browser, e.g. [this](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W2/blob/main/lectures/01_intro.ipynb).\n  - This can be convenient for quick read-only access, without needing to launch the Jupyter notebook/lab application.\n  - But you need to launch the app properly to interact with the notebooks.\n\n## Lecture notes\n\n- All the lectures from last year are [available here](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2024W2).\n- We cannot promise anything will stay the same from last year to this year, so read them in advance at your own risk.\n- A \"finalized\" version will be pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W2) and the [Jupyter book](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2) right before each class.\n- Each instructor will have slightly adapted versions of notes to present slides during lectures.  \n- You will find the link to these slides in our repository: \nhttps://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W2/tree/main/lectures/103-Firas-lectures\n\n## Grades\n\n- The grading breakdown is [here](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2/syllabus.html#grading-scheme). \n- The policy on challenging grades is [here](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2/docs/grades.html#reasonable-grading-concerns).\n\n## Setting up your computer for the course \n\n## Recommended browser and tools\n\n- You can install Chrome [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).\n- You can install Firefox [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). \n\nIn this course, we will primarily be using `Python` , `git`, `GitHub`, `Canvas`, `Gradescope`, `Ed DIscussion`, and `PrairieLearn`. \n\n## Course `conda` environment\n\n- Follow the setup instructions [here](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2/docs/setup.html) to create a course `conda` environment on your computer. \n- If you do not have your computer with you, you can partner up with someone and set up your own computer later.\n\n## Python requirements/resources\n\nWe will primarily use Python in this course.\n\nHere is the basic Python knowledge you'll need for the course: \n\n- Basic Python programming\n- Numpy\n- Pandas\n- Basic matplotlib\n- Sparse matrices\n\nHomework 1 is all about Python.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nWe do not have time to teach all the Python we need \nbut you can find some useful Python resources [here](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W2/blob/main/docs/resources.md).  \n:::\n\n<br><br>\n\n## CPSC 330 vs. 340\n\nRead [https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2/docs/330_vs_340.html](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2/docs 330_vs_340.html) which explains the difference between two courses.  \n\n**TLDR:**\n\n- 340: how do ML models work?\n- 330: how do I use ML models?\n- CPSC 340 has many prerequisites. \n- CPSC 340 goes deeper but has a more narrow scope.\n- I think CPSC 330 will be more useful if you just plan to apply basic ML.\n\n## Break \n\n![](img/eva-coffee.png)\n\n----------------------\n\n## Activity 1\n\\\nDiscuss with you neighbour\n\n- What do you know about machine learning?\n- What would you like to get out this course?\n- Are there any particular topics or aspects of this course that you are especially excited or anxious about?

It learns relevant features on its own. \n::: \n\n::::\n\n## What is ML?  \n\n- ML uses algorithms to learn patterns from data and build models.  \n- These models can:  \n  - Make predictions on new data  \n  - Support complex decisions  \n  - Generate new content  \n- ML systems can improve when trained on more data.  \n- There is no one-size-fits-all model. The right choice depends on the problem.  \n\n\n## When to use ML? \n\n- When the problem can't be solved with a fixed set of rules\n- When you have **lots of data** and **complex relationships**\n- When human decision-making is too slow or inconsistent\n\n| Approach                 | Best for                                 |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Traditional Programming  | Rules are known, data is clean/predictable |\n| Machine Learning         | Rules are complex/unknown, data is noisy  |\n\n# When to use Machine Learning (ML) solutions? \n\n## Example: Supervised classification {.smaller}\n- We want to predict liver disease from tabular features:\n\n::: {#0077cc11 .cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n```{=html}\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th>Age</th>\n      <th>Total_Bilirubin</th>\n      <th>Direct_Bilirubin</th>\n      <th>Alkaline_Phosphotase</th>\n      <th>Alamine_Aminotransferase</th>\n      <th>Aspartate_Aminotransferase</th>\n      <th>Total_Protiens</th>\n      <th>Albumin</th>\n      <th>Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio</th>\n      <th>Target</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>40</td>\n      <td>14.5</td>\n      <td>6.4</td>\n      <td>358</td>\n      <td>50</td>\n      <td>75</td>\n      <td>5.7</td>\n      <td>2.1</td>\n      <td>0.50</td>\n      <td>Disease</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>33</td>\n      <td>0.7</td>\n      <td>0.2</td>\n      <td>256</td>\n      <td>21</td>\n      <td>30</td>\n      <td>8.5</td>\n      <td>3.9</td>\n      <td>0.80</td>\n      <td>Disease</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>24</td>\n      <td>0.7</td>\n      <td>0.2</td>\n      <td>188</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>5.5</td>\n      <td>2.3</td>\n      <td>0.71</td>\n      <td>No Disease</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>60</td>\n      <td>0.7</td>\n      <td>0.2</td>\n      <td>171</td>\n      <td>31</td>\n      <td>26</td>\n      <td>7.0</td>\n      <td>3.5</td>\n      <td>1.00</td>\n      <td>No Disease</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>18</td>\n      <td>0.8</td>\n      <td>0.2</td>\n      <td>199</td>\n      <td>34</td>\n      <td>31</td>\n      <td>6.5</td>\n      <td>3.5</td>\n      <td>1.16</td>\n      <td>No Disease</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Model training \n\n::: {#2185283c .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom lightgbm.sklearn import LGBMClassifier\nmodel = LGBMClassifier(random_state=123, verbose=-1)\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n``````{=html}\n<style>#sk-container-id-1 {\n  /* Definition of color scheme common for light and dark mode */\n  --sklearn-color-text: #000;\n  --sklearn-color-text-muted: #666;\n  --sklearn-color-line: gray;\n  /* Definition of color scheme for unfitted estimators */\n  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-0: #fff5e6;\n  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-1: #f6e4d2;\n  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-2: #ffe0b3;\n  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-3: chocolate;\n  /* Definition of color scheme for fitted estimators */\n  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-0: #f0f8ff;\n  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-1: #d4ebff;\n  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-2: #b3dbfd;\n  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-3: cornflowerblue;\n}\n\n#sk-container-id-1.light {\n  /* Specific color for light theme */\n  --sklearn-color-text-on-default-background: black;\n  --sklearn-color-background: white;\n  --sklearn-color-border-box: black;\n  --sklearn-color-icon: #696969;\n}\n\n#sk-container-id-1.dark {\n  --sklearn-color-text-on-default-background: white;\n  --sklearn-color-background: #111;\n  --sklearn-color-border-box: white;\n  --sklearn-color-icon: #878787;\n}\n\n#sk-container-id-1 {\n  color: var(--sklearn-color-text);\n}\n\n#sk-container-id-1 pre {\n  padding: 0;\n}\n\n#sk-container-id-1 input.sk-hidden--visually {\n  border: 0;\n  clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);\n  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\n  height: 1px;\n  margin: -1px;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  padding: 0;\n  position: absolute;\n  width: 1px;\n}\n\n#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-dashed-wrapped {\n  border: 1px dashed var(--sklearn-color-line);\n  margin: 0 0.4em 0.5em 0.4em;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  padding-bottom: 0.4em;\n  background-color: var(--sklearn-color-background);\n}\n\n#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-container {\n  /* jupyter's `normalize.less` sets `[hidden] { display: none;
