What would be the consequences?\nHow do we measure the success or failure of spam identification?\nIf you want to use this model in the wild, how do you know how reliable it is?\n\nWould it be useful to know how confident the model is about the predictions rather than just a yes or a no?\n\nIt’s great to think about these questions right now.

This technique speeds up convergence. The algorithm implemented is \"greedy k-means++\". It differs from the vanilla k-means++ by making several trials at each sampling step and choosing the best centroid among them.\n\n* 'random': choose `n_clusters` observations (rows) at random from data for the initial centroids.\n\n* If an array is passed, it should be of shape (n_clusters, n_features) and gives the initial centers.\n\n* If a callable is passed, it should take arguments X, n_clusters and a random state and return an initialization.\n\nFor an example of how to use the different `init` strategies, see\n:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_kmeans_digits.py`.\n\nFor an evaluation of the impact of initialization, see the example\n:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_kmeans_stability_low_dim_dense.py`.\n'k-means++'\n\n\n\nn_init n_init: 'auto' or int, default='auto'\n\nNumber of times the k-means algorithm is run with different centroid\nseeds. The final results is the best output of `n_init` consecutive runs\nin terms of inertia. Several runs are recommended for sparse\nhigh-dimensional problems (see :ref:`kmeans_sparse_high_dim`).\n\nWhen `n_init='auto'`, the number of runs depends on the value of init:\n10 if using `init='random'` or `init` is a callable;\n1 if using `init='k-means++'` or `init` is an array-like.\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.2\nAdded 'auto' option for `n_init`.\n\n.. versionchanged:: 1.4\nDefault value for `n_init` changed to `'auto'`.\n'auto'\n\n\n\nmax_iter max_iter: int, default=300\n\nMaximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm for a\nsingle run.\n300\n\n\n\ntol tol: float, default=1e-4\n\nRelative tolerance with regards to Frobenius norm of the difference\nin the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations to declare\nconvergence.\n0.0001\n\n\n\nverbose verbose: int, default=0\n\nVerbosity mode.\n0\n\n\n\nrandom_state random_state: int, RandomState instance or None, default=None\n\nDetermines random number generation for centroid initialization.

Good for structured decision making.\nHuman experts are good with problems which require deep contextual understanding, ethical judgment, creative input, or emotional intelligence."
