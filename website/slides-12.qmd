## Scenario 1: Which model would you pick 

Predicting whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes based on features such as age, blood pressure, glucose levels, and BMI. You have two models:

- LGBM which results in 0.9 f1 score 
- Logistic regression which results in 0.84 f1 score

Which model would you pick? Why? 

## Scenario 2
Predicting whether a user will purchase a product next based on their browsing history, previous purchases, and click behavior. You have two models:

- LGBM which results in 0.9 F1 score
- Logistic regression which results in 0.84 F1 score

Which model would you pick? Why?

## Transparency

- In many domains understanding the relationship between features and predictions is critical for trust and regulatory compliance. 

### Feature importances 
- How does the output depend upon the input? 
- How do the predictions change as a function of a particular feature?

# How to get feature importances? 

## Correlations

- What are some limitations of correlations?

## Interpreting coefficients 
- Linear models are interpretable because you get coefficients associated with different features. 
- Each coefficient represents the estimated impact of a feature on the target variable, assuming all other features are held constant.
- In a `Ridge` model, 
  - A positive coefficient indicates that as the feature's value increases, the predicted value also increases.
	- A negative coefficient indicates that an increase in the feature's value leads to a decrease in the predicted value.

## Interpreting coefficients 
- When we have different types of preprocessed features, what challenges you might face in interpreting them? 
  - Ordinally encoded features
  - One-hot encoded features
  - Scaled numeric features

## Pause and Reflect 

We are now just over half-way through CPSC 330!

You had a midterm already a couple of weeks ago, I'd like some feedback on how things are going in class (as the instructor).

## Class Survey

I'd love to hear how you think lectures are going, and how the course is going overall: [bit.ly/cpsc330_24W1](https://bit.ly/cpsc330_2025S).

## (iClicker) Midterm poll {.smaller}

**Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.**

- (A) I'm happy with my progress and learning in this course.
- (B) I find the course content interesting, but the pace is a bit overwhelming. Balancing this course with other responsibilities is challenging
- (C) I'm doing okay, but I feel stressed and worried about upcoming assessments.
- (D) I'm confused about some concepts and would appreciate more clarification or review sessions.
- (E) I'm struggling to keep up with the material. I am not happy with my learning in this course and my morale is low ☹️.

## Break

Let's take a break!

## Group Work: Class Demo & Live Coding (if time permits)

For this demo, each student should [click this link](https://github.com/new?template_name=lecture12_demo&template_owner=ubc-cpsc330) to create a new repo in their accounts, then clone that repo locally to follow along with the demo from today.
