## Announcements

- Remember, my office hours are MWF from 1:00 - 1:30 PM in DMP 310 (after class)

- Homework 2 (hw2) was released on Wednesday, it is due May 20, 10:00 pm
  - You are welcome to broadly discuss it with your classmates but final answers and submissions must be your own.
  - Group submissions are not allowed for this assignment.
- Advice on keeping up with the material
  - Practice!
  - Make sure you run the lecture notes on your laptop and experiment with the code. 
  - Start early on homework assignments.

- If you are still on the waitlist, it’s your responsibility to keep up with the material and submit assignments!
- Last day to drop without a W standing is today: **May 16, 2025**

## Dropping lowest homework (Update)

- CPSC 330 has 9 homework assignments that are all an integral part of your learning
- To account for illnesses, other commitments, and to preserve your mental health, there has long been a policy of dropping your lowest HW score.
- After some analysis from the data from previous terms (Learning Analytics!), there is a slight modification to this policy:

> **With the exception of HW5,** we will drop your lowest homework grade - all students must complete HW5.

- This is to encourage all students to complete HW5! It's important!

## Recap

- Importance of generalization in supervised machine learning
- Data splitting as a way to approximate generalization error
- Train, test, validation, deployment data
- Overfitting, underfitting, the fundamental tradeoff, and the golden rule.
- Cross-validation

## Finish up demo from last class

For this demo, each student should [click this link](https://github.com/new?template_name=lecture02_demo&template_owner=ubc-cpsc330) to create a new repo in their accounts, then clone that repo locally to follow along with the demo from today.

## Recap

A typical sequence of steps to train supervised machine learning models

- training the model on the train split
- tuning hyperparamters using the validation split
- checking the generalization performance on the test split

## Clicker 3.1

Participate using [Agora](https://agora.students.cs.ubc.ca) (code: agentic)

**Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.**

- (A) A decision tree model with no depth (the default `max_depth` in `sklearn`) is likely to perform very well on the deployment data.
- (B) Data splitting helps us assess how well our model would generalize.
- (C) Deployment data is scored only once.
- (D) Validation data could be used for hyperparameter optimization.
- (E) It’s recommended that data be shuffled before splitting it into train and test sets.


## Clicker 3.2

Participate using [Agora](https://agora.students.cs.ubc.ca) (code: agentic)

**Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.**

- (A) $k$-fold cross-validation calls fit $k$ times
- (B) We use cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of model performance.
- (C) If the mean train accuracy is much higher than the mean cross-validation accuracy it's likely to be a case of overfitting.
- (D) The fundamental tradeoff of ML states that as training error goes down, validation error goes up.
- (E) A decision stump on a complicated classification problem is likely to underfit.

## Recap from videos 
- Why do we split the data? What are train/valid/test splits? 
- What are the benefits of cross-validation?
- What is underfitting and overfitting? 
- What’s the fundamental trade-off in supervised machine learning?
- What is the golden rule of machine learning?

## Summary of train, validation, test, and deployment data 

|         | `fit` | `score` | `predict` |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Train    | ✔️      | ✔️      | ✔️         |
| Validation |      | ✔️      | ✔️         |
| Test    |       |  once   | once         |
| Deployment    |       |       | ✔️         |

## Cross validation

## Cross validation
```{python}
import mglearn
mglearn.plots.plot_cross_validation()
```

## Overfitting and underfitting 

:::: {.columns}

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- An **overfit model** matches the training set so closely that it fails to make correct predictions on new unseen data.  
- An **underfit model** is too simple and does not even make good predictions on the training data 

:::
::::

## The fundamental tradeoff

As you increase the model complexity, training score tends to go up and the gap between train and validation scores tends to go up.  

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](img/malp_0201.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Underfitting: Both accuracies rise
- Sweet spot: Validation accuracy peaks
- Overfitting: Training $\uparrow$, Validation $\downarrow$
- Tradeoff: Balance complexity to avoid both
:::

::::

## The golden rule
- Although our primary concern is the model's performance on the test data, this data should not influence the training process in any way.

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Test data = final exam**  
- You can practice all you want with training/validation data
- But **never peek** at the test set before evaluation
- Otherwise, it's like sneaking answers before the exam $\rightarrow$ **not a real assessment of your learning**.
